    <h1>Statement Completion Value</h1>
    <pre style="text-align: justify; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
      * It's what you get when evaluating a chunk of code.
      * In practice, the only way to access a statement completion value
      within JavaScript is through the return value of an eval call.
      * a) When code is run in the console in Node or Chrome it's wrapped in
           parentheses.

           e.g - It's treated as an object literal
           {a:3} in Devtool is an object; becomes ({a: 4});
      * b) But `eval` just tries to run the code directly which is why you're
           getting the error.

           e.g - It's treated as a code block.
           [eval => this function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.]
           eval ('{a:4, b:5}');
           SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
      * The {} actually represents an "empty" block statement, which also
        completes with "empty".
      * If the completion value is "empty", "undefined" is returned.
      * If the only statement is a non-empty throughout the executing and It's
        the only that isn't a non-empty value, So It will be the completion value.

        e.g
        eval("1;;;;;") => Completion Value => 1
    </pre>

    <h2>How do statement lists behave?</h2>
    <pre style="text-align: justify; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
      [spec] => http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-block-runtime-semantics-evaluation
      * This is what the spec says about the completion value of a list
        of statements:
    </pre>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // The value of a StatementList is the value of the last value producing item
    // in the StatementList. For example, the following calls to the eval
    // function all return the value 1:
    eval("1;;;;;") // 1
    eval("1;{}") // empty => undefined
    eval("1;var a;") // 1

    // a)----------
    eval("1;;;;;")
    // consists of an expression statement (1;) and 4 empty statements (;;;;).
    // Empty statements complete with (big surprise) empty. That means 1; is
    // the only statement that produces a non-empty value. Therefore itâ€™s also
    // the last value producing item and the statement list completes with the
    // value 1.

    // b)----------
    // In the second example from the spec it may look like it should return
    // an empty object. However, the {} actually represents an empty block
    // statement, which also completes with empty.

    // c)----------
    // Finally, the last example is very similar to what we saw at the top
    // of the post.
    "omg"; var x = 4;
    // is a statement list with two statements. Since the completion values
    // are "omg" and empty, the code evaluates to "omg" as the last non-empty value.
  </script>
